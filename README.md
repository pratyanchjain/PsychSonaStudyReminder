# PsychSonaStudyReminder
This is a Python script that sends you email notifications whenever a new SONA study opens up so that you can complete your 15 credits as soon as possible!

## Instructions on how to use
To be able to run this program, you will need to run the run.py file on your local machine. You need to have selenium installed, which you can do with a very simple terminal command:-

``pip3 install selenium``

## Authorization
Upon running the program, you will first be asked for your email account where you will receive notifications. You will also be asked for your SONA username and password for the script to run. 

Then, all you need to do is to let the program keep running in the background. You will get notified via Outlook whenever a new study opens up in which you haven't participated already!

At any point, if you want to exit the program or terminate the search process, any terminal input will do just that. Remember, you need to make sure that the program has a stable internet connection, and that it is kept running.
